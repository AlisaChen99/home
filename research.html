		<h2>Gathering Information</h2>
		<p>
		If you are looking to learn, books and research are crucial throughout your journey. 
		This webpage is directed towards beginners, so book suggestions will be fitting towards them:

		<p>
		Some vendors are also very popular and have affordable prices. My top recommendation is The 
		Gneiss Guy. They are well known, reliable, and have great quality specimens. This is a vendor 
		that has been passing their business down for many generations. If you are not looking to 
		travel abroad specifically to add to your collection, consider this vendor! They usually act
		as a wholesaler, but they appear at virtually all major shows as well as have 2 warehouse sales
		annually (open to the public). They have relations all over the world, so their prices are 
		super reasonable and their variety is unmatched in Canada.

		<!--Mineral collecting location examples-->
		<h2>Where can I Find Specimens?</h2>
		<p>
		<img src="images/fluorite.png" alt="Madagascar Fluorite" class="right">
		Unless you are a diehard rockhound, the reality is that the majority of your specimens are 
		probably purchased at shows or something of the like. Some collectors that are in it for the
		experience may have more to say on this topic, though I am not one of those. Despite this,
		I can attest that Canada is very rich in variety of minerals as well as quantity. If you are 
		located within Canada, I recommend visiting the Mineral Capital of Canada, otherwise known as
		Bancroft, Ontario. They hold annual “Rockhound Gemborees”, which is a huge rocks and minerals 
		show that attracts vendors and collectors all over Canada. Not only that, there are locations 
		within it where you can find nice Apatite, Rose Quartz, and a lot more.
		<br>
		<br>
		If you are planning on travelling internationally in search of a collection upgrade, the best 
		starting points are in India and Madagascar. Both locations are known to produce huge and near 
		perfect crystals. For example, India is known for its Apophyllite and pink Stilbite. Madagascar 
		is known for its Malachite in addition to its fluorite. Fluorite, in case you haven’t drawn the 
		connection, is superbly fluorescent no matter the colour or structure. Overall, India and 
		Madagascar produce their goods in huge quantities with guaranteed low prices.

		<h2>Storing Information</h2>
		<p>
		<img src="images/bookshelf.png" alt="Bookshelf" class="left">
		In order to store the research you have done or the books that you have bought, you should 
		consider placing them close to your collection. If you choose to store your collection on a 
		shelf, perhaps you can leave a space specifically for related books. If you have done research
		online, perhaps you can save all the information in one file so that it is easily accessible.
		To record your progress or review knowledge that you have collected over time, you can document
		it in a personal journal or even create videos/content so that you can look back on how you were 
		in the past. A bonus for the last storage method is that you can even share your knowledge with
		others! Perhaps you can be the reason someone started their rocks and minerals collection!

		<!--Mineral recommendations + tips for beginners-->
		<h2>Useful Information for Starters</h2>
		<p>
		I am going to conveniently sort our a couple examples of minerals that beginners and 
		intermediates respectively can consider collecting. This is for convenience in case you do 
		not know where to start or whether or not you are getting your money's worth. In this circuit,
		it's very easy to be scammed by vendors who are seeking more than they should and are banking
		off of your obliviousness. I can attest that it is very easy to fall into these traps, since
		I have had past experience (though it was easily avoidable).
		</p>
		<h3>Beginner Mineral #1: Quartz</h3>
		<p> 
		Quartz is everywhere. It’s the most common mineral found on the crust of earth. Quartz is 
		in gravel, in sand, and in rocks like granite. It’s used industrially and commercially. The
		difference is that most rockhounds seek quartz’s various properties that make it unique as
		well as comparatively affordable. It ranks at 7-7.5 on the Mohs Scale, meaning that it is
		durable and easy to store. If you drop it on a wooden floor, it most likely will not break. There
		is also plenty of variety. Quartz comes in various sizes, shapes, as well as colours. The 
		cause for this is due to impurities of all sorts. For example, Amethyst has iron impurities
		that give it a purple colour.

		</p>
		<h3>Beginner Mineral #2: Calcite</h3>
		<p>
		<img src="images/calcite.png" alt="Calcite Specimen" class="right">
		Calcite comes in just as many varieties and colours as quartz, if not more. As you can see
		with the Calcite pictured on the right, it can have splendid colouring, though this depends
		on the location for which it was found. Not only that, Calcite can form many crystal structures. 
		Notable forms include Dogtooth Calcite and Iceland Spar. The reason they are classified as 
		beginner friendly is because of their abundance and affordability. Unfortunately, in comparison 
		to Quartz, finding gem quality Calcite is much rarer, meaning that it costs a little more. It
		is also relatively soft at 3 on the Mohs Scale, which can make it harder to sustain and not 
		ideal as jewellery.
		</p>
		<h3>Intermediate Mineral #1: Fluorescent Minerals</h3>
		<p>
		Fluorescent minerals are minerals whose electrons get excited when an ultraviolet light is 
		shined at them. The electrons temporarily jump up and go into a higher orbit. Particles are 
		activated to the extent of which they emit a visible glow. Different elements emit different 
		colours due to their chemical properties. The reason this group of minerals have been classified
		as “intermediate” is because they are harder to obtain and handle. At shows, they are more 
		expensive because this special property is not common. Not only that, to see the true extent
		of their glory, you have to have an ultraviolet light (ideally long wave) on hand. Examples
		include Scapolite, Mangano Calcite, Ruby and Hackmanite.
		<img src="images/fluorescent.png" alt="Fluorescent Minerals" class="bigimg">
		</p>
		<h3>Intermediate Mineral #2: Gems/Faceted Minerals</h3>
		<p>
		<img src="images/gem.png" alt="Amethyst Gem" class="right">
		To be completely honest, most collectors of minerals are not active seekers of these. This is 
		because over time, you’ll realize that the beauty of many minerals is their crystal structure 
		and natural appearance. Minerals have their own distinctive crystal shapes and properties that
		make them unique. The reason faceted minerals are considered intermediate is because not only 
		are they expensive due to the labour put into them, they can be limited in terms of what is 
		actually sustainable. Minerals like Cerussite cannot be worn as daily wear in jewellery because
		it is so fragile and can easily shatter upon contact. They can only be kept in careful 
		maintenance, ideally in cases. An example of Cerussite as a gem is the Royal Ontario Museum’s 
		“Light of the Desert”.
