		<h1>Additional Supplies</h1>
		<p>
		At times, your collection may be too good for your own display. You may become 
		interested in smaller specimens or fluorescent specimens, in which case, you can 
		require additional supplies, which is what we will cover here. Attached are also
		two videos about supplies and rock lover gift ideas that can be completed with
		additional items.

				<th>Item</th>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Loupe</td>
				<td>Loupes are useful and affordable to act as a portable alternative for magnifying 
				glasses. When combined with a lanyard, you can easily carry it in a purse or hang it 
				around your neck. To use a loupe, you put it near a specimen you want to study and look
				through the glass to observe more detail.
				<td> ~$12-$30 CAD</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Microscope</td>
				<td>Microscopes are used to identify smaller specimens and look at them in detail.
				They are primarily used for microminerals that may not otherwise be easy to 
				appreciate. For example, you may have traces of silver, copper, or even tiny crystals of
				quartz.</td>
				<td> ~$90-$700 CAD</td>
				<td><img src="images/microscope.png" alt="Microscope"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>UV Flashlight</td>
				<td>Ultra-violet flashlights are pretty self explanatory. Fluorescent minerals require
				these to show their true colours. When purchasing, you should look for long wave lights 
				rather than short wave because those are more dangerous and can cause damage to your 
				eyes easily. Be careful when using any form of UV flashlight. Some flashlights are 
				also better quality than others, so play around until you find your match!</td>
				<td> ~$12-$40 CAD</td>
				<td><img src="images/uvflashlights.png" alt="UV Flashlights"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Plastic Baggies</td>
				<td>Once your collection starts growing, you may have specimens that you no longer 
				want. The ideal form of protecting for when you stash rocks is to insert a foam or soft 
				divider of some sort. Sometimes, this is not only time consuming but also a waste of 
				resources. The next best tip is to store them in plastic baggies instead. They provide 
				a little protection and keep you specimen together with its label.</td>
				<td> ~$10-$25 CAD</td>
				<td><img src="images/plasticbaggie.png" alt="Plastic Baggies"></td>

		Have you ever wanted to go collecting yourself? Well, before that, there are some supplies that 
		are strongly recommended that you have before you go out! These are not only to ensure safety,
		but also to ensure success, wherever you may be collecting!
		</p>
		<!--Table displaying items specifically for rock collecting, descriptions, and images-->
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Item</th>
				<th>Description</th>
				<th>Image</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Safety Goggles</td>
				<td>Safety goggles do exactly what you'd expect; they keep your eyes safe and protected!
				Oftentimes, pieces of small rock can fly into your face as your hitting it with a hammer.
				The downsides of goggles are that they can get foggy, though you can purchase special spray with 
				them. The reason you should own a pair is because unlike hard hats, most sites don't provide 
				these for you.</td>
				<td><img src="images/goggles.png" alt="Safety Goggles"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Safety Boots</td>
				<td>The most important aspect to look for in safety boots is that they are CSA approved. This can
				be found through a green triangle on the side of the boot (as shown in the image on the right).
				If you are unable to obtain CSA approved boots, the next best option is to wear sturdy footwear. 
				This is to protect your feet from fallen rocks or from any other hazards while collecting.</td>
				<td><img src="images/boot.png" alt="Safety Boot"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Safety Vest</td>
				<td>Safety vests are used to ensure that you are clearly visible, whether you are in the midst of  
				a forest or digging in a pile of boulders. The most common style is to have stripes on the front 
				of them and a big X on the back. Even if you don't believe it to be useful, it's still important.
				There are certain sites for example, where you may be collecting next to forklifts that will have
				operators who may miss you.</td>
				<td><img src="images/vest.png" alt="Safety Vest"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Fork</td>
				<td>To keep it convenient, it's generally not recommended to bring a large garden fork onto a site.
				Instead, you can consider purchasing a smaller version that achieves the same result on a smaller 
				scale, which also means more detailed scavenging. Forks while collecting are usually used for 
				plowing through loose dirt or debris as the tines are not very strong or easy to exert force on.</td>
				<td><img src="images/fork.png" alt="Fork"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Chisel</td>
				<td>These may be one of the most useful tools when dealing with hard rock. Chisels can be used
				to make or expand cracks in the rock so that you can access whatever crystals may be inside.
				You can even purchase a variety of sizes for your convenience. When using a chisel, it's 
				important that you don't accidentally hurt yourself with the tool itself or the hammer that 
				punches it in.</td>
				<td><img src="images/chisel.png" alt="Chisel"></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Hammer</td>
				<td>This is the hammer that goes along with the chisel. Without it, you are much less likely 
				to be able to create any form of change in the rock you're operating on. To use a hammer, you 
				simply position the chisel into the rock like a nail and hammer it down on the side that's flat.
				These hammers are known to be heavy, so if you are uncomfortable carrying it around, there are
				alternatives such as using a geological hammer instead.</td>
				<td><img src="images/hammer.png" alt="Hammer"></td>
			<tr>
				<td>Geological Hammer</td>
				<td>When collecting, you should <b>never</b> use a carpenter's hammer since they are not suitable 
				for rock and can break on impact. Your alternatives are masonry hammers or geological hammers.
				To differentiate them, look at the back end of the hammer. For geological hammers, it is flat.
				For carpenter's hammers, there is a small indent used for extracting nails.</td>
				<td><img src="images/geologicalhammer.png" alt="Geological Hammer"></td>
