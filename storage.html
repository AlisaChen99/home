		<h2> Storing your Specimens </h2>
		<p>
		When looking for a place to store your collection, understand that keeping your specimens 
		safe should be your priority. Different specimens require different types of maintenance. 
		Let's go over some of them.
		</p>
		<!--Examples of two minerals that require special maintenance + storage tips-->
		<h2> Okenite & Pyrite</h2>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td> 
				Okenite is a special case. This is less catered towards one mineral but rather 
				towards all with similar brittleness. Okenite has extremely small crystals to the 
				extent of which they break upon touch. It's recommended that nothing touches the 
				crystals. It can be a good idea to protect them with a case. Other minerals like 
				talc or gypsum desert roses act in similar ways. In these situations, it is also best 
				to move specimens as little as possible.
				</td>
				<td> Pyrite is prone to pyrite's disease because of its chemical composition and it
				being a metal. Other metals can be affected as well. Pyrite's disease is where the 
				specimen starts breaking down from the inside, turning black, until it can no longer 
				hold itself together. Pyrites should be kept away from each other so that there is 
				less risk of the disease spreading. Additionally, they can be kept with silica gel 
				packets (found in seaweed and other packaged foods) or other dehumidifiers since humidity
				boosts risks.
				</td>

		<h2>How do I Store my Collection?</h2>
		<p>
		<img src="images/mystorage.gif" alt="My Storage" class="left">
		I store my collection in a shelf that covers a wall. Each section has a specific theme. 
		For example, I have a fluorescent minerals cubicle, a shell cubicle, 2 fossil cubicles,
		and a lot more. I know of other collectors who sort their collection by alphabetical order,
		chemical properties, colour, etc. I generally shelve in a way that ensures all of them are 
		visible. I place the smaller specimens in the front and larger/taller ones in the back. I’ve 
		also purchased stands and painted wooden blocks to elevate certain rocks, especially those
		that I want in the spotlight. If you’ve found any of these tips helpful, consider applying
		them to your collection as well! 
		</p>
	
		<h2>Labels</h2>
		<p>
		<img src="images/labels.png" alt="Labels" class="right">
		How important are labels? Important enough to get their own section! Cataloging your specimens 
		is a feasible alternative, but it requires a bit more attention to detail and there is generally 
		the goal of potentially selling your specimens, so we won’t focus on that. To optimize your 
		appreciation over time, however, it’s still a good idea to be able to identify them. If you are
		unable to track some of this information, simply skip over it or put “N.A.” After all, a label 
		is simply to act as an aid for you.
		<br>
		<br>
		<!--Making label format bold (important information)-->
		Label format: <b> Name, location, date collected, who collected, additional information </b>
		</p>

		<p> 
		This process can be somewhat tedious and time consuming, but know that in the end, it will be well worth it. 
			If you have ever considered passing down your collection to future generations or even to sell it, then
			the label will make your life as well as theirs a lot easier. The reason this is so useful for vendors 
			is because sometimes, collectors are looking for both the mineral type as well as where it’s from. Some 
			localities simply produce higher quality specimens or less specimens, making them worth more or less 
			accordingly.
